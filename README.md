OnPoint - App

This app is designed to keep track of deadlines at school and university. Not only that, but it is connected to Teachcenter/Moodle, so you can easily see all the assignments for the different subjects. In detail view, you can see the files that the professor has uploaded, the description and the deadline. Everything can be connected to external calendars and todos to keep an easy overview.
